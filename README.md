# Angular5Test1

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.2.

## What has been done

Created Angular project with CLI
Installed angularjs
Installed bower
Added bower.json with the Angularjs and other packages based on Phonecat example
Installed upgrademodule
Installed typings based on the upgrade guide
Added .angular-cli.json added scripts instead of index.html (is there really no better way in Angular CLI?)
Added an1 map with some Angularjs code
Added angularjs decorators in index.html
Bootstrapped the Angular module

REMARKS:
I did an 'ng eject' but I reverted, it might have caused additional package installs 
Angularjs js files can't be converted to ts files at the moment because of script links in .angular-cli.json
